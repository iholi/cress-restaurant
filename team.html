      <h3><img src="images/Phil-Pierce.jpg" alt="Phil Pierce" class="img-left">Assistant Sous Chef</h3>	
	  <p>Phil's father was a master technician so his first job was as an auto mechanic. He was interested in music from a very young age and wrote his first song at almost five years old on the piano. In his teens, he moved to guitar. Having a technical mind, Phil needed to take his guitar apart and figure out how it worked. He later was trained in building and repairing guitars by Gibson custom shop. This led Phil on a path that took him around the world more than twenty times as a guitar tech for many successful bands. As a young child with two brothers, two sisters and a mom who hated to cook, Phil decided to pick up her red and white plaid Betty Crocker cook book and figure it out. Because of this he gained a love for cooking. The feeling that he got when he was cooking was calming as he knew they were going to eat. Phil still gets this feeling and feels at home in a kitchen. This feeling drove him to work and learn with and from some really great chefs. Phil has never been to culinary school but has also been told he didn’t need to by chefs with respectable educations. Phil have moved on from the pizza shaped like South America that he made as a preschooler and has fallen in love with making beautiful and delicious art on the plate. Phil is always pushing for a higher level of cooking and can’t stand the feeling of failing to make himself better every day. Phil could be working on cars or building guitars or working many careers that pay much more but, he is happy in the kitchen. Phil belongs in a kitchen. And Phil is lucky enough to have a beautiful fiancé that wants him to do what he loves. They have a two year old daughter who is only interested in mac n cheese but he's working on her.</p>
